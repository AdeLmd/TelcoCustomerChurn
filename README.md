# TelcoCustomerChurn
**BACKGROUND**

Telco Customer Churn case study is likely based on a real-world scenario in the telecommunications industry, where companies are constantly trying to improve customer retention rates and reduce churn. Churn is a significant problem for telecommunications companies, as it results in the loss of revenue and can damage their reputation.
To address this problem, data analysis has to understand the customers and identify the factors driving churn. By analyzing customer data, identify patterns and trends that can help develop targeted retention strategies, improve their products and services, and ultimately increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**BUSINESS TASK**

Develop effective retention strategies to reduce churn and increase customer loyalty

**FOCUS**

1. Analyzing customer data to identify patterns and trends that are associated with churn.
2. Developing predictive models to identify customers who are at risk of churning.
3. Recommending targeted retention strategies.

DATA PREPARATION AND DATA CLEANING


To answer the business problem of reducing customer churn, data was sourced from a public dataset on Kaggle, which provides data for public use. The dataset was originally collected and published by a telecommunications company and has been made available to the public for research and analysis purposes. By using this data, the analysis was able to provide valuable insights and recommendations that can help companies better understand and address customer churn.

DATA PREPARATION


I chose to use SQL for my data cleaning and exploration process because the dataset was relatively large, with 21 columns and 7032 rows. After importing the CSV file into MySQL, I named the table "customers" to make it easier to work with in my analysis.

**DATA CLEANING**

After a thorough review, it appears that the data provided for this case study was already relatively clean and did not require significant additional cleaning or pre-processing. This was likely due to the data being sourced from a reputable public dataset. The data was reviewed for missing or invalid values, inconsistencies, and outliers, and any identified issues were addressed before further analysis.


STATISTICS ANALYSIS


As part of my analysis, I employed a range of summary metrics to address the business problem. I calculated the total number of customers, churn rate, average monthly charges, top 5 tenure distribution, service usage, contract type, dependent customers, payment method, and top 5 additional service engagement. Furthermore, I examined the impact of paperless billing on customer behavior. By analyzing these metrics, I gained valuable insights into the customer base and identified key areas for improvement. My experience with data analysis allowed me to effectively utilize the available data and make informed recommendations to drive business growth and success.


RECOMMENDATION


Based on the analyzed insights, there are recommendations aimed at developing effective retention strategies to reduce churn and increase customer loyalty. 

1. Offer loyalty rewards or incentives to long-tenured customers to encourage their continued subscription.

2. Design retention programs tailored to customers' tenure groups, addressing specific needs and concerns.

3. Improve internet service quality and provide robust security features.

4. Offer bundled packages or discounts on additional services like tech support or device protection to increase perceived value.

5. Encourage customers to opt for longer-term contracts by providing benefits or discounts for annual or multi-year subscriptions.

6. Simplify billing and payment processes to reduce friction and potentially offer flexible payment options.

7. Leverage customer data to personalize marketing efforts and communicate tailored offers or promotions based on service usage.

8. Reach out to at-risk customers with targeted campaigns aimed at addressing their specific concerns or needs.

9. Enhance technical support services, possibly through more proactive assistance or better self-help resources, reducing the need for customers to seek alternatives.

10. Regularly gather customer feedback to identify pain points and areas of improvement, then actionable steps to address them promptly.
